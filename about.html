    <p>my name is <strong>snake</strong> (he/him). i'm an everything hobbyist whose primary interests align with earth sciences and tech that sucks less (which usually means older and/or open source). i like making art, gardening, hiking, photography, video games, reading... too many to list.</p>
    <p>i had a personal site in the 2000's where i first shared my art and fiction (no one visited it, thank god lol), so i'm familiar with what the internet was like before social media and capitalism ruined everything. i'm trying to regain that experience (minus the bad parts), and encourage others to seek it as well.</p>
    <p>my worldview and actions are done through a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queer">queer</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantheism">pantheist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animism">animist</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism">anarchist</a> lens. i reject hierarchies in all forms, including but not limited to sexism, racism, ableism, fascism/authoritarianism, nationalism, anthropocentrism, and so on. i also support concepts like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-culture_movement">free culture</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_repair">the right to repair</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_liberalization">drug liberalization</a>.</p>
